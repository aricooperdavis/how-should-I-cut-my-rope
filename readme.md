# How should I cut my rope?
Enter the ropes you want to cut, and the ropes you already have, to find out the trips you could rig by cutting your rope into different lengths.

### Usage notes

The results are displayed in terms of possible trips and efficiency.

- Possible trips describes the number of trips in the database that can be rigged for a given rope-cut combination.
- Efficiency describes the average ratio of rope carried for a trip that is needed for that trip. For example rigging a 10m pitch with a 100m rope would have an efficiency of 0.1, whilst using a 20m rope for the same pitch would have an efficiency of 0.5.

The cut lengths listed in the table and on the graph are only for those ropes that you have opted to cut, however the possible trips and efficiency calculation factors in your other ropes too.

This tool evaluates every single possible combination of potential rope cuts. Therefore if you choose to cut very long and/or a high number of ropes, or choose a high resolution (small number), processing may take a very long time. All processing is done in your browser using client-side javascript.

### Data Sources
This tool is driven by the same data that drives the [what can I rig](https://github.com/aricooperdavis/what-can-I-rig/) tool.
